Instantly.AI to Airtable SyncThis project contains a Python script orchestrated with Prefect.io to extract email account data from Instantly.AI and load it into a specified Airtable base.üóÇÔ∏è Project Structuremain.py: The main entry point for the Prefect flow. This script defines the tasks and the overall workflow for the ETL process.utils.py: Contains helper functions for interacting with the Instantly.AI and Airtable APIs, as well as data mapping logic.schemas.py: Defines Pydantic models for data validation and structure.requirements.txt: A list of all the Python libraries and dependencies required to run this project.üöÄ Getting StartedPrerequisitesPython 3.9+An active Prefect.io Cloud account (Hobby plan is sufficient).An Instantly.AI account with API access.An Airtable account with API access and a base configured according to the provided documentation.üîë Prefect Blocks SetupBefore running the flow, you must configure the following secret blocks in your Prefect.io Cloud workspace:Instantly.AI API Key:Name: instantly-api-key-helloheroType: SecretValue: Your Instantly.AI API key.Airtable API Key:Name: airtable-api-keyType: SecretValue: Your Airtable Personal Access Token or API key.üì¶ InstallationClone the repository:git clone [https://github.com/laviefatigue/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/laviefatigue/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name
Install dependencies:pip install -r requirements.txt
‚ñ∂Ô∏è Running the FlowYou can run the Prefect flow from your local machine after authenticating with Prefect Cloud.Authenticate with Prefect Cloud:prefect cloud login -k YOUR_PREFECT_API_KEY
Run the main flow:python main.py
The script will then execute the flow, extract the data from Instantly.AI, and populate your Airtable base. You can monitor the run from your Prefect Cloud dashboard.‚öôÔ∏è ConfigurationThe Airtable base_id and table_id are hardcoded in the utils.py file as per the documentation provided. If you need to change these in the future, you can modify the AIRTABLE_BASE_ID and AIRTABLE_TABLE_ID constants.
